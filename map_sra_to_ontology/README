This directory contains the code implementing the ontology mapping 
pipeline as well as the sample-type classifier.

The pipeline can be run on a set of sample-specific key-value pairs
using the run_pipeline.py script. This script is used as follows:

    python run_pipeline.py <input key-value pairs JSON>

The script accepts as input a JSON file storing the key value pairs.
To provide an example, the pipeline will accept:

{   
    "ID": "P352_141",
    "age": "48",
    "bmi": "24",
    "gender": "female",
    "source_name": "vastus lateralis muscle_female",
    "tissue": "vastus lateralis muscle"
}
