# MetaSRA: normalized sample-specific metadata for the Sequence Read Archive

This repository contains the code implementing the pipeline described in the preprint:
http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/19/090506.

This pipeline will not work out of the box from this repository as it requires downloading of external resources. We are working to write a setup script that will allow users to run the pipeline on their own.
